        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>cheesecake, a dessert consisting of a thick, creamy filling of cheese, eggs, and sugar over a thinner crust and topped with sweet or sometimes salty items.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <h3>Crust</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups (128g) graham cracker crumbs, 9 to 10 whole graham crackers, crushed</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup (28g) confectioners' sugar</li>
                    <li>5 1/3 tablespoons (74g) butter, melted</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Filling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>two 8-ounce packages (452g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup (152g) granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Step 1</h3> 
                <p>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</p>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</p>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</p>
