        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>100 ml tomato ketchup</li>
                <li>1 tomato</li>
                <li>2 onion</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chilli flakes</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>100 gm processed cheese</li>
                <li>4 mushroom</li>
                <li>1/2 capsicum (green pepper)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
                <li>1/2 cup mozzarella</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dry yeast</li>
                <li>water as required</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.</p>

                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams (a little less than 1 cup) lukewarm tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.
                    </p>
                
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape it for pizza.)</p>

                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top and bake.</p>
